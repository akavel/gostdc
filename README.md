gostdc provides C Standard Library (alias libc) for porting legacy C programs to compile with [the Go compiler suite][goc] [Work In Progress].

  [goc]: http://golang.org/cmd/cc/

QUICK USAGE
-----------

  * `go get github.com/akavel/gostdc`
  * `cd github.com/akavel/gostdc`
  * `cp copy_me/*.h $MY_PROJECT/`
  * edit `$MY_PROJECT/gostdc.h` to make sure it has right number of `../` segments
  * in some Go file `$MY_PROJECT/*.go` add: `import _ "github.com/akavel/gostdc"`


TODO
----

  * slap license on the files + add AUTHORS file.
  * write full pretty readme
  * remove any left 'golua' in file contents
  * fix `strstr()` (it now uses simple naive O(m*n) algorithm) or
    reuse some MIT/BSD implementation for it
  * fix all FIXMEs and/or reuse some MIT/BSD implementations
  * extend the library to cover all of Standard C Library
  * [optionally] replace most C functions with some MIT/BSD
    implementations
  * split the .c and .go files functionally as .h files would suggest
